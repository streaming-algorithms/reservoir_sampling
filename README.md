# Reservoir sampling

**Reservoir sampling** is a family of randomized algorithms for choosing a simple 
**random  sample without replacement** of **k** items from a population of unknown 
size n in a **single pass** over the items. 
The size of the population **n** is not known to the algorithm and is typically too 
large to fit all n items into memory. 
The population is revealed to the algorithm over time, and the algorithm cannot look 
back at previous items. 
At any point, the current state of the algorithm must permit extraction of a simple 
random sample without replacement of size k over the part of the population seen so far.

Let's suppose item i appears **m** times in the population. Probability of item i 
being i the sample is **P(item i in sample) = k * m / n**
